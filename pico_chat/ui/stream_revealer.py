"""Smooths the reveal rate of streamed text.

A ``StreamRevealer`` buffers arrived text and releases it in grapheme-cluster
grains spread over at most ``max_window`` seconds, decoupling the rate text
*arrives* from the rate it *appears*. All time is passed in by the caller, so
the controller is deterministic and unit-testable without a clock.

Design:

- Each buffered stretch is anchored to the arrival time of its **oldest**
  character; the deadline is ``oldest + max_window``. A character is therefore
  never held longer than ``max_window`` (default 250 ms), regardless of how many
  newer chunks merge into the buffer.
- Grain = non-whitespace grapheme clusters; intervening whitespace is released
  for free. A small chunk reveals a cluster per frame; a large chunk spreads
  across the window.
- Behind schedule (``now >= deadline``) \u2192 release everything (catch-up).
