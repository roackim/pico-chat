# UI Architecture

Pico's TUI is built from scratch — no curses, no third-party TUI framework. It owns the full rendering pipeline.

---

## Layer Stack

```
chatTUI (app.py)
  └─ Compositor (tui/compositor.py)       ← render loop, FPS throttle
       ├─ Container layout (tui/container.py)
       │    ├─ ChatHistoryPanel           ← scrollable message list
       │    ├─ InputComponent             ← multi-line editor
       │    └─ DebugLogPanel (optional)   ← dev logging
       └─ Overlays (floating, on top)
            ├─ SelectionMenu              ← autocomplete dropdowns
            └─ Popup                      ← centered text popups (/help, /config)
```

Typed event dataclasses are defined in `tui/events.py`. Shared focus ownership
is provided by `tui/focus.py`.
`FocusScope` provides modal focus boundaries. `EventRouter` dispatches keyboard
events to the active focus target after application policy handling.
`EventRouter` provides overlay-priority dispatch and layout-based mouse
hit-testing for compositor input.
Keyboard input is normalized to string-compatible `KeyEvent` objects at the
terminal boundary, and terminal resize notifications are dispatched as
`ResizeEvent` objects.
The application-level input/history focus state is backed by `FocusScope`; its
domain-specific Up/Down and inline-editing rules remain in `chatTUI`.

There is one conversation per process: the app owns its runtime agent, history
panel, queue, worker, and conversation-local tool/permission state. Slash
commands use one application-level worker and remain responsive while
conversation generation is running.

## Status Bar

The chat workspace includes a one-line `StatusBar`. Its visible fields and
order come from `pico_cfg.config.ui_status_bar_fields`; the default is:

```toml
[ui]
status_bar_fields = ["endpoint_model", "role", "context"]
```

The default display is `endpoint:model  role agent  ctx 12.4k/32k`.
Available values include `endpoint_model`, `endpoint`, `model`, `context`,
`role`, `state`, and `workspace`. Provider-reported prompt usage replaces the
context estimate after a response supplies authoritative usage data.

The `context` field is colorized by how full the context window is:
green below 33%, orange/amber below 66%, and red at or above 66%.

The `role` field reflects the active conversation role and is refreshed
whenever the role changes (via `/role <name>` or a conversation import that
applies a saved role).

## Conversation import/export

`/export <file>` writes `{"role": ..., "history": [...]}`.
`/import <file>`:
- Fuzzy-autocompletes `.json` files in the current directory.
- Restores the saved role; if the role no longer exists, it falls back to the
  `agent` role and posts a warning message in the chat.
- Rebuilds visible messages, splitting assistant thinking/content with the
  same `ThinkingTagParser` the harness uses (so imported reasoning renders as
  a `ThinkingMsg`).

## Library Contracts

### Widget Lifecycle and Ownership

Containers assign child geometry through `set_layout()` and `layout()`. The
compositor renders the root tree after layout, then renders registered overlays
above it. Components mark content changes with `mark_changed()` and geometry
changes with `mark_layout_changed()`; the compositor uses those states to
request redraws. Widgets own presentation and local interaction, screens own
workflow and focus/action scope, and the application owns domain state and
services.

### Event and Focus Flow

`EventRouter` checks overlays from newest to oldest first. An unhandled event
then passes through the application interceptor, semantic `ActionMap`, mouse
hit path, focused widget, or root fallback as appropriate. Mouse paths are
built from component rectangles and are tried child-first; a component stops
propagation by returning `True`. The application interceptor handles policy
and focus transitions. `FocusScope` selects the keyboard target and keeps
modal focus bounded.

### Layout and Coordinates

Coordinates are zero-based terminal cells. Component rectangles use absolute
`x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`; the right and bottom edges are exclusive.
Containers allocate child rectangles before rendering. `Padding` insets a
child, `Align` positions it within its allocation, `Stack` paints children in
order, and `ScrollView` clips content to its viewport. Rendering writes to the
allocated `Buffer` or `SubBuffer` and should not perform layout for siblings.

### Screens and Navigation

Create a screen by composing components into a root, then pass optional
`FocusScope`, `ActionMap`, and model values to `Screen`. Install an initial
screen with `Navigator`; use `push`, `pop`, `replace`, or `back` for movement.
Use `ModalHost.present_screen()` for modal screens so enter/leave lifecycle
hooks and overlay ownership are handled together.

### API Stability

The stable library surface is the typed events, `Action`/`ActionMap`, focus
scopes, `Component`, layout primitives, reusable components, `Screen`,
`Navigator`, and `ModalHost`. Modules named
as application adapters, private attributes (leading `_`), compositor internals,
and legacy `chatTUI` callbacks remain internal and may change during migration.

### Library-Only Example

The former `example_screen.py` was removed in the toolkit pruning pass. There is
no library-only demo screen; tests compose library primitives directly.

## Integration Boundary

Behavior-preserving migration: keep compatibility at the application boundary
and remove legacy paths only after production references reach zero.

## Compositor (`tui/compositor.py`)

- Runs an async render loop at ~30 FPS
- Manages overlay stacking (e.g., permission prompts, menus, popups)
- Tracks dirty state; only redraws when something changed
- `Compositor.invalidate()` — marks the frame as needing redraw
- `add_overlay(component)` / `remove_overlay(component)` — register floating components rendered on top of the main tree

## Popup System (`tui/components/popup.py`)

Centered overlay popups for commands that benefit from floating display rather than chat history messages.

- `Popup` extends `Component`, built on `Box` + `TextComponent` component tree
- `show(title, content)` — displays popup, auto-centers, registers with compositor
- `hide()` — dismisses popup, unregisters from compositor
- **Action bar**: `[Esc] close` rendered by Box's native action system — identical positioning and style to message box action bars
- **Clickable action bar**: hit regions computed by Box during render; click detection uses Box's `_action_hit_regions`
- **Scroll**: arrow keys (±1), mouse wheel (±3), clamped to bounds
- `PopupAction(key, label)` dataclass — compatible with Box's `.format()` action protocol, no MsgAction coupling
- Scroll position indicator overlaid on bottom-right when content overflows
- Input interception: when popup is visible, the `EventRouter` overlay-priority
    path routes input to the popup before normal focus handling
- Auto-sizing: `max_width_ratio` / `max_height_ratio` control popup dimensions relative to terminal
- Currently used by: `/help` (command list)

## No In-App Forms

The interactive form stack (`form.py`, `form_popup.py`, `field_models.py`,
`form_schema.py`, `role_editor_model.py`, `config_overlay.py`, `input/basic.py`)
was removed. Configuration is edited as files: `/config <section>` and
`/config role <name>` open the file in `$EDITOR` and reload. Interactive UI is
reserved for permission approval and destructive confirmation; see
[notes/principles.md](./principles.md).


## Single Conversation

There is one conversation per process. The app (`chatTUI`) owns the agent,
history panel, message queue, generation task, tool state, and pause/steer
state directly; there is no `ConversationRuntime`, `TabView`, or `TabBar`.

## Shutdown

Ctrl+C is read as a raw `\x03` byte by the compositor's input loop
(`_handle_shutdown_key`), which sets `running = False` and the app
`shutdown_event`. `agent_worker` races its queue against `shutdown_event`, and a
`shutdown_watcher` task cancels any in-flight generation, so one Ctrl+C exits
promptly and cleanly. `main.py` also swallows a stray `KeyboardInterrupt` so a
mis-timed interrupt never prints a traceback.

## Debug Panel

The debug console is a `DebugLogPanel` (extends `TextComponent`) wrapped in a
`DebugPopup` compositor overlay. `TuiLogHandler` feeds it log entries and
`ChatHistoryPanel.activity_sink` routes `SysMsg*` to the activity overlay
(`/activity`). There is no user-facing debug-panel command; logging is enabled
via `debug.toml` (`log_enabled`).

## Buffer (`tui/buffer.py`)

- Grid of `Cell` objects (character + foreground RGB + background RGB)
- `SubBuffer` — a viewport into a parent buffer, enables clipping
- Components write to their allocated `SubBuffer`; compositor merges and flushes to terminal

## Components (`tui/components/`)

All components extend `Component` (base.py):
- `render(buffer)` — draw self into SubBuffer
- `handle_input(event)` — process keyboard/mouse events
- `dirty` flag — set when state changes, cleared after render

Key components:
- `Box` — bordered wrapper with optional title and action buttons
- `TextComponent` — static/scrollable text display
- `SelectionMenu` — floating dropdown with fuzzy filtering
- `InputComponent` — multi-line editor (see below)
- `DebugLogPanel` — scrolling log display
- `MarkdownComponent` — live markdown renderer (see [Markdown Rendering](#markdown-rendering) below)

## Input Component (`tui/components/input/`)

The most complex component. Responsibilities are split across sub-modules:

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `input.py` | Coordinator; cursor animation, menu orchestration, schema-driven parameter hints |
| `text_buffer.py` | Text storage, undo/redo |
| `input_handlers.py` | Keyboard, mouse, paste events |
| `completion.py` | `Completer` base + the four trigger-based providers: `CommandCompletion`, `SubcommandCompletion`, `ArgumentCompletion`, `ContextCompletion` |
| `scroll_manager.py` | Scroll offset for large input |
| `cursor_renderer.py` | Cursor visibility and animation |
| `coordinate_mapper.py` | Screen position → text offset |

### Completion menu styling

All four input completion menus (command `/`, subcommand, argument, `@` file
picker) share **one** look, applied by `Completer._apply_selector_style()` in
`input/completion.py`:

- `set_fill_width(True)` — span the full screen width;
- `frame_color = theme.USER` — accent frame;
- `content_color = theme.DEFAULT` — normal suggestion text;
- descriptions rendered as muted, right-aligned tails
  (`SelectionMenu.item_descriptions`, optionally a `footer` tag).

**Rule:** a new completion provider must call `self._apply_selector_style()` in
its constructor and pass descriptions via `_show(..., descriptions=...)`. Never
style one provider's menu inline — that is how the argument menu drifted from
the `/` and `@` menus. Descriptions come from `Command.get_descriptions(...)`
(`Param.descriptions`, or an override such as `ConfigCommand` for `/config role <name>` / `/config theme <id>`).

### Schema-Driven Parameter Hints

When typing a `/command`, the input component shows grey hints for upcoming parameters. This is driven by the `Param` dataclass on each `Command`:

1. `resolve_command(parts)` walks the command/subcommand tree to find the deepest matching `Command` and the argument offset
2. `_get_parameter_hint()` reads `cmd.params[arg_index:]` and joins them with spaces
3. Hints are rendered at the end of the current text (not at the cursor position)
4. The current argument being typed is skipped from the hints

## Mouse Interaction Model

The TUI supports full mouse interaction via ANSI SGR mode (`?1006h`).

### Text Selection
- **Start**: Click on message content area → `start_selection()` records anchor position
- **Drag**: Mouse move events → `update_selection()` extends highlight (throttled at 50ms for performance)
- **End**: Mouse release → `end_selection()` finalizes selection and auto-copies to clipboard
- **Yank**: Press `y` to copy current selection to clipboard at any time
- Selection is rendered as a reverse-video overlay via `_render_selection()` using segment-level fast-skip optimization
- Hit testing uses a cached line map (`_line_map_cache`) invalidated on scroll/message changes

### Action Button Clicks
- Action buttons (e.g. `[c] copy`) in box bottom borders are clickable
- `_hit_test_action_bar()` computes button hit regions on-demand (replicates Box border layout calculation)
- Clicking triggers the action with a brief **reverse-video flash** feedback (150ms)
- Flash is managed by `_flash_msg` / `_flash_action_key` / `_flash_until` on `ChatHistoryPanel`
- Box renders the flash by checking `parent_msg._flash_action_key` and applying `reverse=True`

## Message Types (`tui/msg_types.py`, `chat_message.py`)

Every message displayed in the chat history has a `MsgType` that controls its title, border color, content color, and available action buttons.

### MsgType Hierarchy

| Class | Title | Frame Color | Actions |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `MsgType` | *(base)* | DEFAULT | none |
| `UserMsg` | "user" | USER | COPY |
| `PicoMsg` | "pico" | PICO | COPY |
| `ThinkingMsg` | "thinking" | MUTED | COPY |
| `SysMsg` | "system" | MUTED | COPY |
| `SysMsgError` | "error" | ERROR | COPY |
| `SysMsgWarning` | "warning" | WARNING | (inherits COPY) |
| `ToolCallMsg` | "tool" | WARNING | OUTPUT, COPY |
| `ToolDraftMsg` | "tool" | MUTED | none |
| `AskPermissionMsg` | "permission" | PERMISSION | ALLOW, DENY, OUTPUT, COPY |

`ThinkingMsg` and `SysMsgError/Warning` extend `PicoMsg` / `SysMsg` — they inherit defaults and override only what differs.

Actions are deliberately limited to non-destructive operations. State-changing
actions (retry/stop/steer/pause/resume) and removal/edit are **not** message
actions; when needed they belong to explicit commands. `SysMsg*` notices are
routed to the activity surface rather than the transcript (see below).

### MsgAction Enum

| Action | Key | Label |
|--------|-----|-------|
| `COPY` | `c` | copy |
| `OUTPUT` | `o` | output |
| `ALLOW` | `a` | allow |
| `DENY` | `x` | deny |

### Message Selection and the Mode Line

Messages are gutter-threaded and do not render actions inline. User and pico
messages use a `▌` prefix bar spanning the full message height
(`Box.full_height_gutter`) — user in the `USER` accent, pico in `MUTED`
gray; user content is normal text color (the accent is only the bar).
`ChatHistoryPanel` keeps a `focused_message_index` (the selected message); the
selected message's prefix bar is replaced with a brighter `▌` marker (no extra
column, nothing shifts, no leading margin).

An **action line** sits above the input with a blank pad row above it
(`ActionBar.set_top_pad`): an `ActionBar` mounted permanently in the workspace
body (`ChatScreen(..., action_bar=...)`), collapsed to zero rows and expanded to
two (pad + content) when needed. The app (`_update_action_strip`) drives it in
two modes:

- **Message selected** — shows the message's actions (`[c] copy`, `[o] output`,
  permission `[a]/[x]`) in the muted style, right-aligned as a group with the
  `↑↓ move · esc back` hint (`ActionBar.set_align_right`).
  Mouse clicks are dispatched by the app interceptor to
  `ActionBar.handle_input`; key dispatch goes through
  `ChatHistoryPanel.handle_input` → `on_action`. `ChatHistoryPanel` notifies the
  app via `on_selection_changed`.
- **Input focused** — shows a single muted, right-aligned hint:
  `[/] command [@] file [$] shell    ↑↓ move`. `@` works mid-text, so the line
  stays visible while typing. `InputComponent.on_change` (fired on every text
  change) refreshes it.

The status bar stays visible below in both modes. `Esc`/`Enter`/`i` clear the
message selection and collapse the line.

### Activity Surface and Toasts

Non-conversation output (shell commands/results, command status, errors, role
changes, generation-stopped notices) must not live in the transcript.
`ChatHistoryPanel.add_message` routes `SysMsg`/`SysMsgError`/`SysMsgWarning` to
`activity_sink` when set; the app's sink appends to the **activity overlay**
(a `DebugPopup`-style overlay toggled by `/activity`) and shows a transient
**toast** in the status bar (`StatusBar.set_toast`, auto-expiring). The returned
message is detached (not appended). Explicit `ui.activity(text)` writes to the
overlay only.

### How to Add a New Message Type

1. **Define the class** in `pico_chat/ui/tui/msg_types.py`:
   ```python
   class MyMsg(MsgType):
       name = "my_type"
       title = "my title"           # shown in box border
       frame_color = "WARNING"      # key in theme dict (colors.py)
       content_color = "MUTED"      # optional; None = default text color
       actions = [MsgAction.COPY, MsgAction.DELETE]
   ```
   Use an existing class as a base if it's a variant (e.g. `class MyMsg(SysMsg)`).

2. **Import it** wherever you create messages (usually `app.py` already imports all types).

3. **Use it** when adding to the chat panel:
   ```python
   ui.chat_history_panel.add_message("text", msg_type=MyMsg())
   ```

4. **Handle any new actions** — if you added a new `MsgAction`, wire up a handler callback in `ChatHistoryPanel` (e.g. `on_my_action`) and connect it in `app.py` via `ChatActionHandlers`.

### How Messages Are Displayed

`ChatHistoryPanel.add_message(text, msg_type, title=None, ...)` creates a `Message` object and appends it (or routes it to the activity sink for `SysMsg*`).
`Message` wraps a `TextComponent`/`MarkdownComponent` inside a thread-mode `Box`
(role gutter, no border).

**Padding is owned by the `Box`.** The panel passes the wrap width to `Message`
(content width = panel width − gutter − padding); `Box` lays the child out at
`x + gutter + content_pad_left` with width reduced by the right pad. Content
components render *unpadded* (plain text is no longer pre-padded and
`MarkdownComponent` gets `left_pad=0`), so "where content starts and how wide it
is" has a single owner. `Message.append()` drops leading whitespace on the first
chunk, since models often open with a space.

Messages are separated by `ui_msg_v_margin` blank lines (default `1`; set it in
`ui.toml`). `ChatHistoryPanel` is the owner of the message list — it handles
layout, selection, scrolling, and width-change reformatting.

## Commands (`commands/` package)

Slash commands typed by the user (e.g. `/model`, `/theme`, `/help`).
The package lives in `pico_chat/ui/commands/`:

- `registry.py` — the single `COMMANDS` assembly point and `handle_command()`.
- `base.py` — `Param`, `Command`, `ChatUIProtocol`, completion helpers.
- Domain modules (`core`, `conversation`, `models`, `roles`, `themes`) import
  **only** `base`; `registry.py` assembles them. This shape is enforced by
  `test/test_command_import_graph.py`.
- Leaf commands are plain `async def` handlers wrapped in
  `Command(name, description, handler=..., params=[...])`. Only commands that
  need contextual completion subclass `Command` (currently `ConfigCommand`);
  subcommand-tree classes remain supported.

### Registered Commands

`help`, `clear`, `reload`, `config`, `edit`, `export`, `import`, `compact`,
`exit`, `stop`, `activity`, `model`, `role`, `theme`

### Server & model selection

- Servers are configured by editing `servers.toml` (`/config servers`); there is
  no `/server` command.
- `/model` — opens a searchable picker; `/model <model>` selects directly. Refreshes discovery live, resolves a model across servers, switches the harness, and selects it. The picker (`SearchModal`) shows the cached catalog instantly, refreshes in the background, tags the current model with a green `active`, and supports type-to-filter.

### Roles

- `/role` lists roles (marking the active one) or switches with `/role <name>`.
- `/config role <name>` creates/opens `roles/<name>.toml` in `$EDITOR` and reloads;
  `/config role delete <name> confirm` removes it.

### Themes

- `/theme` opens a searchable picker (built-ins plus `themes.toml` definitions);
  `/theme <name>` selects directly and persists it in `state.toml`.
- `/config theme` edits `themes.toml`.

### Structure

- `Param` dataclass — a command argument: `name`, `completions` (static list or callable), `descriptions`, `path` (filesystem scan), `required`.
- `Command` — `name`, `description`, `handler` or `subcommands`, `params`. `resolve_command()`, `get_completions(arg_index, prior_args)`, `get_descriptions(...)`, `execute(ui, args)`.
- `COMMANDS: Dict[str, Command]` — registry.
- `handle_command(ui, text)` — strips the leading `/`, looks up `COMMANDS`, calls `execute`.

### How to Add a New Command

1. Write a handler in the relevant domain module (or `core.py` for a general one):
   ```python
   async def cmd_mycommand(ui: ChatUIProtocol, args: List[str]):
       ui.chat_history_panel.add_message("hello", msg_type=SysMsg())
   ```
2. Register it in `registry.py`:
   ```python
   "mycommand": Command("mycommand", "One-line description", handler=cmd_mycommand,
                        params=[Param("NAME", required=True)]),
   ```
   `Param` definitions drive parameter hints and fuzzy argument autocomplete;
   `path=True` adds filesystem scanning.
3. It is now callable as `/mycommand`, listed by `/help`, and offered by the input autocomplete.

For contextual completion (decide candidates from earlier args), subclass
`Command` and override `get_completions` / `get_descriptions`; see
`ConfigCommand` in `commands/core.py`.

### Hiding a Command from `/help`

Prefix the registry key with `_`; `cmd_help` / `get_command_descriptions` skip such names.

## Terminal I/O (`tui/terminal.py`)

- Sets raw mode, captures mouse/keyboard events
- `ANSI` constants for escape codes
- `Terminal.write()` flushes the buffer to stdout

## Colors and Layout

- `tui/colors.py` — `RGB` class, theme dictionary, hex parsing
- `tui/layout_utils.py` — `wrap_text()`, `display_width()` (wcwidth-aware for Unicode), `strip_ansi()`
- `tui/container.py` — explicit layout pass; `Vsplit`/`Hsplit` support fixed, percentage, content, and fill policies, with `Padding`, `Align`, `Stack`/`Overlay`, and `ScrollView`

### Theme switching

Components resolve theme colors when they are **constructed**, not per render
(the `theme` singleton is mutated in place by `set_theme()`, so re-render alone
does not recolor cached fg/bg). A theme change therefore must:

1. `set_theme(name)` — mutate the palette in place;
2. `chatTUI.refresh_theme()` — re-resolve the chrome (input, bars, debug/activity
   panels), the long-lived overlays (`Popup`, `DebugPopup`), the cached
   completion menus (`InputComponent.refresh_theme()` →
   `Completer.refresh_theme()` → `SelectionMenu.apply_theme()`), and every
   transcript message (`Message.refresh_theme()`), then call
   `Compositor.request_full_redraw()` so cached frame cells are discarded.

Anything that stores a `theme.*` color at construction and lives across a theme
switch must expose a `refresh_theme()` (or `apply_theme()`) and be called from
`chatTUI.refresh_theme()`. `/theme` and `_apply_theme()` (called by `/reload`
and `/config`) do this. `/theme` additionally registers a `ThemePreview` overlay
(a compact top-strip palette overview) while you move through the list and
previews each theme live via `SearchModal.on_highlight`; cancelling restores the
previous theme. The picker is kept short (`max_height = 8`) so the top overview
and the input-anchored picker don't overlap. The default theme is `terminal`.

## Markdown Rendering

Live markdown rendering for chat messages, added to support streaming output with rich formatting.

### Modules

- `tui/components/markdown.py` — parser + `MarkdownComponent` (append-only commit path for streaming; `parse(open_tail=True)` renders the open line plain)
- `tui/ascii_table.py` — `AsciiTable` renders markdown tables with squared-style borders
- `tui/syntax_highlight.py` — `highlight_line(line, lang)` tokenises code blocks for coloring

### Pipeline

1. `BlockParser` splits raw text into blocks (paragraphs, headers, code fences, lists, quotes, HR, tables)
2. `InlineParser` parses inline `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, `[text](url)`
3. `Markdown.parse()` returns `List[List[StyledSegment]]` (display lines)
4. `MarkdownComponent` wraps lines to the component width (word-wrap for prose, hard-break for code blocks/tables)
5. `render()` writes styled segments to the buffer

### Incremental (streaming) updates

`MarkdownComponent.update(text, append=True)` commits *complete* lines atomically
and re-parses/re-wraps only the open (uncommitted) tail, so an append costs
O(open region) rather than O(message length):

- `BlockParser.find_commit_line(lines, start, last_open)` returns the largest
  line index that can be committed: a line the parser visits outside a
  fence/table, never the still-growing last line, never a run of trailing blank
  lines, and never a potential table header whose separator has not arrived.
- Committed segments/wrapped rows are cached (`_committed_parsed` /
  `_committed_wrapped`) and only ever appended to. The open region is re-parsed
  and re-wrapped each append, then concatenated after the caches.
- `take_dirty_from_line()` returns the open region's first wrapped row
  (reduced across appends); `Box`/`MessageView` reuse that as the tail raster.
- **Open-tail rendering (approach A):** while the final line is still growing it
  is rendered *plain* (no `InlineParser`), so closed spans such as `**bold**` on
  the open line stay literal until its newline arrives. `set_streaming(False)`
  (called by `Message.finalize()`) re-parses in full so the line is styled.
  `Markdown.parse(..., open_tail=True)` carries the same rule; tests use it for
  a streaming-aware reference.
- An open code fence or table is held whole until it closes (bounded by its own
  size); a single never-ending line is still re-wrapped per append (O(line)).

`notes/bench_render.py` has a `stream` scenario (append+render per frame) and a
`stream_micro` table (µs/append vs length for prose/code/table); baseline in
`notes/bench_stream_baseline.json`.

### Styling

Styles are driven by `pico_cfg.config.markdown_styles` (see [config.md](./config.md)). Each element (`header1`–`header6`, `bold`, `italic`, `code`, `code_block`, `quote`, `list`, `hr`, `table`, `link`, `paragraph`) maps to `fg`/`bg`/`bold`/`reverse`.

### Tables

Markdown tables (`| ... | ... |` with a `---` separator row) are detected by `BlockParser`, grouped into `TableLine` runs, and rendered via `AsciiTable` with the `squared` style. Table lines are rendered with `code_block=True` so the wrapper hard-breaks instead of word-wrapping, preserving column alignment.
